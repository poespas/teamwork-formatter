# teamwork-formatter

Ok, so with my internship I have to log every day what tasks I did that day, but the problem is, I basicly have to do the same at work in teamwork.com , so me being all lazy, I wrote this simple script that converts the output of teamwork to a format that's acceptable for my internship, easy as that!! :)


oh btw;
npm install fs moment jsonexport
